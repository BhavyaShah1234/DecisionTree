This is Bhavya Shah live.
I will be demonstrating a live demo of the decision tree classifier I created using sklearn
First we will be importing the necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc
Then we will be importing the dataset from my google drive
I have shuffled the dataset using the sample method of pandas
As Id is not an important or deterministic factor or attribute, we will remove it
Now let us take the unique values of our output and its count
As each category of Iris has 50 samples hence this dataset is balanced
Now let us encode the output columns using the LabelEncoder class in sklearn library
Let us now split our dataset into features(X) and labels(Y) and convert our features into numpy array of shape (150, 4)
Now let us train our decision tree model with hyperparameters max_depth and min_samples_split and take the score of accuracy
Let us plot the decision tree we created
The boxes represent the nodes of our tree
Thank you
